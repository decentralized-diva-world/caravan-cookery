# Caravan Cookery

Welcome to our cooking book, Caravan Cookery.

This book is a collection of recipes we have made as we have caravanned around Western Europe, France and Spain in particular. Some of newly discovered, some are classics we have enjoyed making (and eating) for years. Some we have been inspired to cook, some are simply convenient "belly-fillers", necessary when the cupboards are bare or the weather is bad. Many aren't even from the same region we have been travelling in; we have just had a craving for Thai green curry in Granada, chilli mussels in Dinard or fish tacos in Magherafelt.

A few notes about this cookbook...

Firstly, some of these recipes aren't necessarily easy to make out of a standard caravan. We've had the time to deck out the caravan with many of the kitchen accessories we need to create a variety of meals (although it is amazing what one can accomplish with a two ring Spanish burner and a 60cm paella pan). So, pick out the ones that you can confidently cook with the equipment you have. 

Secondly, you may struggle to source some of the ingredients some of the recipes ask for, but, you should be able to substitute with alternatives. For example, in France, fromage frais is a product available just about anywhere. However, you may struggle to find it anywhere else. No problem. Just use cream cheese instead. And, if you just can't source it, don't worry, just omit it. This isn't condon bleu but it's infinitely better and more satisfying than McDonalds.

Lastly, You're suppose to be enjoying yourself on holiday. This is about communal cooking and spending time with family and friends. You want to cook a meal that everyone can sit around and enjoy. So, if you can, try and cook in a shared setting where you can prepare meals and talk and have fun at the same time.

We have included some hints, tips and explanations about our rig; what pans we use, the burners we have purchased, what doesn't work, etc. While it is a guide, it may help explain how we have tackled some of the recipes. For example, space what you cook. If you want to make moules frites and you only have one pan, you're probably going to have to prepare the moules and then the frites. Think "tapas"-style (a handy approach we picked up in southern Spain).

Now, on to the recipes...
